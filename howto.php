It is completely curable and we are here to help you out. But let us first understand what

            <p class="lead">Yoga: In Sanskrit root yuj means to “yoke,” “bind,” or “join together.” It also indicates
“union” or “Oneness.”
According to verse 19th of chapter 6 th of Bhagwad Gita,

“यथा दीपो निवातस्थो नेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता |
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मन: ||”

In this verse, Shree Krishna gives the simile of the flame of a lamp. In the wind, the flame
flickers naturally and is impossible to control. However, in a windless place, the flame
becomes as steady as a picture. Similarly, the mind is fickle by nature and very difficult to
control. But when the mind of a yogi is in enthralled union with God, it becomes sheltered
against the winds of desire. Such a yogi holds the mind steadily under control by the power of yoga</p>

            <p class="lead">There are 8 limbs of Yoga called as Ashtang which are:<br>
1. Yama: Yama includes some ethical rules or moral imperatives such as non-violence,
truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity and non-avarice.<br>
2. Niyams: It includes virtuous habits and observances such as clearness of mind,
contentment, self-discipline, studies of vedas, contemplation of god etc.<br>
3. Asanas: Asana is a posture that one can hold for a period of time, staying relaxed, steady,
comfortable and motionless.<br>
4. Pranayam: Pranayam is the control of the breath, from the Sanskrit prana (breath)<br>
5. Pratyahara: Pratyahara is a combination of two Sanskrit words prati (against or contra)
and ahara (bring near, fetch). Pratyahara is drawing within ones awareness. It is a process
of retracting the sensory experience from external objects.<br>

6. Dharana: Dharana means concentration, introspective focus and one-pointedness of
mind. The root of the word is “dhr” meaning to hold, maintain or keep.<br>

7. Dhyana: Dhyana literally means contemplation, reflection and profound, abstract
meditation. Dhyana is contemplating, reflecting on whatever Dharana has focused on.<br>

8. Samadhi: Samadhi literally means putting together, joining, combining with, union,
harmonious whole, trance. Samadhi is oneness with the subject of meditation<br>.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Yoga in simple words <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Yoga is a 5000 years old spiritual discipline. It unleashes spiritual
and mental power of individual. Let us understand the science behind it:<br>

1. Human body secretes a hormone called as cortisol when mind gets severely
stressed. Yoga moderates the production of cortisol and reduces the stress level of
a person.<br>

2. Yoga stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms us down and
restores balance after a major stress is over. Whenever parasympathetic nervous
system switches on, heartbeat reduces and lowers blood pressure.<br>

3. Yoga naturally generates Dopamine, a chemical in the brain that gives one
contentment during a high on drug. Thus, the craving for contentment of addiction
is no longer manifested. Addiction is one of the main cause as well as symptom of
mental illness.<br>

4. Yoga enlarges human brain. It increases brain cells of an individual. This has been
proven that Yogis have larger brain volumes that contain mental mapping of our
body, involved in direct attention, critical to dampening stress and areas key to our
concept to the self.<br>

5. Yoga helps us in staying at present. It makes an individual attentive and gives the ability to let go of negative thoughts<br>.</p>

            <p class="lead">Today Ayurveda is becoming
increasingly popular with psychiatric patients as a method to reduce drug dependence.
According to Charak Samhita,<br>

हिताहितम सुखं दु:खमायुस्त्स्य हिताहितम l मानं च यत्रोक्त्मायुर्वेद: स उच्चयते ll<br>
Ayurveda deals with good and bad life (Ayu), as well as happy and unhappy life (Ayu). It
explains what promotes health and what affects health adversely. It also deals with what
affects life expectancy and the quality of life.<br>
 A happy person is one: “Who is devoid of mind
and body imbalances, whose senses are perfectly functioning, whose body is full of ojas
(strong immunity), tejas (shine) and prana (energy), well respected, hardworking, brave,
intellectual, scholar, prosperous and can perform all duties without obstacles”<br>
A person is said to have good health if his/her physical and psychological elements are
balanced. Human being is a constitution of mind, body soul and senses (manas, sharir, atma
and indriya respectively). Senses includes psychological senses (gyanindriya) and physical
senses (karmindriya).<br>

Manas is further a constitution of three operational qualities or gunas which are Satva, Rajas
and Tamas. These three gunas define the character of a person. Satva guna is amalgamation
of self-control, knowledge and power to determine right and wrong in life.<br> The qualities
of Rajas guna are to be in motion, violent, envious, authoritative, desirous and confused. The
characteristics of Tamas guna include being dull, inactive, sleepy, lazy and drowsy. The
imbalance of these three guans is responsible for mental illness or Manovikar.<br>

Also, the sharira or body is comprised of three physco-biological elements which are
Vata(Air), Pitta(Fire) and Kapha (Earth). These elements are essentially negative in nature
and hence called as tridoshas (three faults) but they actually protects the body. When these
tridoshas go awry they may affect mind and cause mental illness.<br>

The treatment of Ayurveda focuses on balancing the three gunas and thridoshas. There are
various ayurvedic medicines and herbs that are recommended by Ayurveda practitioners to
balance them and achieve good mental health. Ayurveda is one of the best<br></p>

            <p class="lead">1. An ideal routine is the key to happiness: As you know, there is a particular time and
way to complete one’s basic all day’s work. One should wake up before sun-rise, do
some physical exercise daily, have a heavy breakfast and a light dinner and follow an
ideal daily routine. This is proven that a well-scheduled routine helps an individual to
cope with changes and reduce stress. Daily routine has far-reaching mental health
benefits. This minor effort can improve your mental health.<br>
2. Books, music and movies can uplift your mood: According to new research from
Oxford University Press, reading challenging language sends rocket boosters to our
brains, which in turn boosts our mental health. Classics from William Shakespeare
and Charles Dickens were proven to help relieve depression and chronic pain,

according to Stylist.<br> Reading is a common habit among most of the successful and
famous personality. Most of them actually believe that good books and blogs have
changed their lives.<br>
Research confirms that music is effective for relaxation and stress management.
Upbeat music can make you feel more optimistic and positive about life. A slower
tempo can quiet your mind and relax your muscles, making you feel soothed while
releasing the stress of the day. <br>
You must have heard that “Action speaks louder than words”. Inspirational movies
can boost your confidence. According to a survey most of the people have admitted
that they feel happy and more confident after watching an inspirational movie. They
can work with more enthusiasm after watching such movies. Also, watching movies
encourages emotional release. Infect those who cannot express their emotions freely

emotions and expressing emotions helps in reducing stress.<br>
