many pending assignments to submit before deadline and much more. But it is fine. Don’t
take too much stress. Here are few tips to reduce mental pressure:<br>
1. Remember, people may differ in abilities and qualities but time is the only thing
which is distributed equally among all. What you have to do is to plan the best way to
utilize your 24 hours. Planning or following a time-table will save your time and
increase your productivity and so you will be able to do more work in less time.<br>

2. You should know how important a particular work is. Learn to categorize your work
among most important, important and least important tasks. Try to finish most
important tasks first. This will surely help you in reducing stress.<br>

3. Don’t wait forof the last datedeadlines. You should try to finish your work few days
before the deadline. You may get some extra work at the last moment. This habit will
help a lot in such situations.<br>
4. Never compare your work, grades and performance with that of others. Don’t engage
in any unnecessary competition with your teammates or classmates. You should be
your only competitor. Try to perform better than the previous day. Always remember,
everybody has itshis own specialty and expertise.<br>
5. Do not expect too much from yourself or your life. Learn to accept failures or
rejections. Your parents may have some expectations with you too. You should try to
fulfil them but not at the cost of your mental peace. Sometimes, situation may be
unfavorable or results may be not according to your expectations but never doubt your
capabilities and asks you parents to have faith on you..</p>

            <p class="lead">
1.Do not compromise with your health. Eat balanced diet, drink plenty of water and
take complete 7-8 hours of sleep. Do not ignore health problems such as head-ache or
body-ache. Remember, physical fitness is the first step to maintain a sound mental
health.<br>
2. If you are getting angry or frustrated, please do not react. Start reverse counting or
chant your favorite prayer repeatedly. Most of the people reacts too early and later
feels sorry for their inappropriate words or actions. Relax your mind. Your early
reaction will make it difficult and time-consuming for you to get out of bad mood.<br>
3. Be an open book in front of your closed ones. Everyone have a favorite person in
his/her his life, who understand him/her completely, listen all his/her problems and try
to suggest best solutions. Never hesitate to share your problems with your favorite
person. Although you may not get a solution every time, sharing your emotions will
help you in reducing stress and bad moods.<br>
4. Yoga and meditation are also very helpful if you have mood swings. If possible, yYou
should pray daily. Repeat this words in your mind again and again just before
sleeping and just after getting up in the morning: “I am calm, peaceful and happy”.<br></p>
